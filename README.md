# Capture lists come before a closure’s parameter list in your code, and capture values from the environment as either strong, weak, or unowned. We use them a lot, mainly to avoid strong reference cycles – aka retain cycles.

## Deciding which to use isn’t easy when you’re learning, so you can spend time trying to figure out strong vs weak, or weak vs unowned, but as you progress with your learning you’ll start to realize there’s often only one right choice.
